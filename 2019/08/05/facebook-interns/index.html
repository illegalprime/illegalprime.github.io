    <p>I wake up at 6:45 A.M. in a hotel room and start following some people who look like me.
Soon a herd of young early-twenty-somethings begins to form and amoebas its way across suburban Palo Alto.
We’re all funneled by exceptionally loud organizers into a bus and driven to
1 Hacker Way, a.k.a. Zuck-town (or Zuckerberg, I guess).
I sat next to a Journalism intern; he blew my mind by telling me that
Facebook wants to hire journalists, but why?
It was a different time.</p>

<p>I’m greeted by some <em>really cool l33t</em> playfully calling me a <code class="highlighter-rouge">n00b</code>,
but it’s too early and I’m too sensitive to being patronized.
Would you greet your new employee with a reminder of how inexperienced they are?</p>

    </a>
    </div>
    
</div>

<p>They also had a pirate flag (yarggh maties!).
I can’t call it dumb because <em>my</em> <a href="https://tulip.co/">workplace</a> has a pirate flag,
so I’ll call it a cheap appeal to make me forget that my work is at best meaningless
and at worst spreading click bait and anti-vaxxer propaganda.</p>

<p>But the worst part of working at Facebook and the orientation were all these
signs that made feel bad for not being as excited as they were to be there.</p>

<p>The also had Black Lives Matter signs mixed in,
which is an excellent movement to support.
They should’ve destroyed all their signs <em>except</em> Black Lives Matter.</p>

<p>But apart from that we got:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>BUILD SOCIAL VALUE</em></li>
  <li><em>EXPECT TO FEEL DIFFERENT</em> (like after eating the food?)</li>
  <li><em>MOVE FAST</em> (like to the bathroom?)</li>
  <li><em>DOUBT YOUR DOUBTS</em></li>
  <li><em>PROCEED AND BE BOLD</em></li>
  <li><em>FOCUS ON IMPACT</em></li>
  <li><em>THIS IS YOUR COMPANY NOW</em></li>
  <li><em>NEW WAYS OF SEEING</em></li>
  <li><em>MAKE SPACE TO THINK</em></li>
  <li><em>BE THE NERD</em></li>
  <li><em>STAY FOCUSED AND KEEP SHIPPING</em></li>
  <li><em>NOTHING AT FACEBOOK IS SOMEBODY ELSE’S PROBLEM</em></li>
  <li><em>BE OPEN</em></li>
</ol>

<p>I mean <em>BE OPEN</em>?
We were told <em>on that stage</em> to <em>never</em> talk to reporters, ever.</p>

<p>And Oh My Hashem, there was this one post with Mr. T on it that said
“I pity the fool who doesn’t use ⌘T”, what does that <em>mean</em>?
I don’t have a mac but I assume it means open a new tab?
What fresh hell of office humor is this?
Why make someone feel bad about how they use a computer?
Who would laugh at that?
No one? Is that the point?</p>

<p>We recently bought a succulent and we’re naming it “Succerberg”.
Every time I see it I’ll think of free food, meandering around
the office, not working, and listening to The Adventure Zone.
<em>That’s</em> what’s so great about Facebook,
that’s why you should work there.</p>

<p>That and $9,000 a month.</p>

<p>I was not asked to come back full-time.</p>
