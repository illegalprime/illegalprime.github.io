To whom it may concern,

I am sorry to inform you that our much anticipated “end of the week / middle
of the term” party has been cancelled.
An unfortunate incident involving our late and dear friend Andrew Dai caused
his early departure from this world.
This cucumber & lubricant related incident was a shock to the entire NaN 0528 community.
At the time of writing we are contacting his family members and loved ones with
detailed descriptions and video of the incident.
Rest assured in knowing we will be putting pressure on Georgia Tech to educate
its students on putting pressure on their internals.
We will also advocate that the word “shafted” should no longer be used in an facetious
manner, as some students could take it to the extreme.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may haved caused you.

We only wish that Andrew could have partied one more night.

Yours always,
 — Michael
