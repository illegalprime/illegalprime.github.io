## Michael’s Rising Manhood
Michael's manhood has [almost finished](http://itsalmo.st/#cinco-de-michael) rising!
And we'd like all of you to be there to see it.
(Please note - do not ask about his rise or his manhood as his
girlfriend can't attend and will be v jealous).

Like being picked first for dodgeball,

Like realizing your dad is only human,

Like seeing the Falcons at the Superbowl,

Like watching Titanic (for the first time),

turning 21 only happens ONCE in EVERY YOUNG BOY’S (MAN'S) LIFE.

Be the Jack to his Rose in this grand scene of de-flowerment!
(Drawing him naked is optional).
Be there. at midnight. (and before) when Michael becomes a man.

We’re talking **drinks**. [ Legal drinks ].

**Music**.  [ Grown-up music ].

**Atmosphere**. [ 100% grain-fed, gluten-free, free-range atmosphere ].

**Games**, and **_Gains_**

This is your chance to do that thing you've wanted to this entire semester.
Drunk dial your ex! Tell that special someone how you really feel!
But most of all, have a good time.

## Notable Testimonials:
 - “Why is my invite Titanic-themed”
 - "When I first met Michael he said 'finish my Venmo payment already' and
   he still asks me that to this day!"
 - “If you go into Michael’s bathroom and say ‘Michael Eden’ three times
   he’ll appear and ask you what you’re doing.”
 - "Oh yeah, I know him."
 - "If I were [Michael] I would pay me to say this, but I'm not."
 - "If you took the Georgia Tech Stadium and filled it with Michaels, it
   would total more people than a home game."

## Potent Potables:
 - Beer, etc.
