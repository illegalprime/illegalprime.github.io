Jew jokes have always been a tough spot for me.
Am I Jewish enough to make them?
Or am I only Jew-<i>ish</i>?
Today I didn't answer either, instead a perfect scenario descended from the _Shamayim_.

I've stared to take Improv lessons, I thoroughly enjoy it.
I always wanted to have an outlet that involved humor and I've learned some presentation skills too.
I want to share the dialogue from a scene I did with another student.
Bear in mind we have only a few lessons of Improv under our belt.
The topic was "Christmas", see if you can catch it, I speak first:

---

"I want my kids to feel equal on Hanukkah, so I'm trying to put all my presents under the menorah.
But they won't fit!"

"Oh cool! Maybe you should just get a larger table."

> I bring two chairs over and arrange them like a table.

"I thought we'd actually buy a table, why this?"

"No no no, this is _much_ cheaper."

"Yeah you're being really frugal!"

> We're interrupted by the instructor.

"Stop!"

My partner for this scene, by the way, is a wonderful person.
It's really difficult to pay attention to the context you're in while you think of what to say next,
so I'm surprised that I haven't seen _more_ moments like this.
It's also half my fault for starting with such a racially tinted premise,
but I did think this was funny.
Earlier that lesson I had the topic "Rainbows", and I immediately thought about "Gay Pride",
and it took a lot of work to think of something different.

I ended up picking "leprechaun".
