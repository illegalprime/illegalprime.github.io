This is one of my number one best dating tips!
If you've been kissing a girl or boy and want to take it to the **next level**,
put on some nice woolen socks and start shuffling on a nearby rug. 
Wait for your special someone to come home and give them a kiss.
If you were disciplined enough to only touch lips, they should feel a strong
static shock. That's when you whisper:

> _Did you feel that spark?_
