# September Ends

Why do we cook bacon but bake cookies?

Think about it.

That's right, every interaction we have is being recorded.

In this case its in invitation form.

Cat got on the keyboard again..

Did you know cats are subsidized by our government to sedate America?

Of course not.

Every time you kiss your cat, pheromones are released in your bloodstream.

Wait, you won't understand complex biology.

Nobody understands.

What is this about?

It's about getting woke!

It's about waking up, when September ends.

# April Fool's

Some said it would be impossible: extending our spring break a week into the term!
But together we can make that dream a reality, together we can nurture our
collective denial
of our academic responsibilities, together we can make our week great again!

Comming to you from the 5 2 8 repping the North Side bringing you the
dopest party on this side
of the MARTA, feat. amazing drinks, music, games, and dank memes is the:

## END OF THE WEEK / MIDDLE OF THE TERM RAGER! (BACK TO SCHOOL EDITION)

Featuring:
 - Pepe the frog
 - An inevitable vomit-filled elevator
 - A relaxed global perspectived requirement
 - Dean Zvi in a Banana Hammock Mankini
 - Michael not getting laid
 - A windowsill of empty bottles and dreams
 - White dance moves
 - A beatiful view of the cocola building
 - Air Conditioning
 - WiFi
 - do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers
 - Bass
