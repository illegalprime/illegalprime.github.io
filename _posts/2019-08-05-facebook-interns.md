I wake up at 6:45 A.M. in a hotel room and start following some people who look like me.
Soon a herd of young early-twenty-somethings begins to form and amoebas its way across suburban Palo Alto.
We're all funneled by exceptionally loud organizers into a bus and driven to
1 Hacker Way, a.k.a. Zuck-town (or Zuckerberg, I guess).
I sat next to a Journalism intern; he blew my mind by telling me that
Facebook wants to hire journalists, but why?
It was a different time.

I'm greeted by some _really cool l33t_ playfully calling me a `n00b`,
but it's too early and I'm too sensitive to being patronized.
Would you greet your new employee with a reminder of how inexperienced they are?

They also had a pirate flag (yarggh maties!).
I can't call it dumb because _my_ [workplace](https://tulip.co/) has a pirate flag,
so I'll call it a cheap appeal to make me forget that my work is at best meaningless
and at worst spreading click bait and anti-vaxxer propaganda.

But the worst part of working at Facebook and the orientation were all these
signs that made feel bad for not being as excited as they were to be there.

The also had Black Lives Matter signs mixed in,
which is an excellent movement to support.
They should've destroyed all their signs _except_ Black Lives Matter.

But apart from that we got:

1. _BUILD SOCIAL VALUE_
2. _EXPECT TO FEEL DIFFERENT_ (like after eating the food?)
3. _MOVE FAST_ (like to the bathroom?)
4. _DOUBT YOUR DOUBTS_
5. _PROCEED AND BE BOLD_
6. _FOCUS ON IMPACT_
7. _THIS IS YOUR COMPANY NOW_
8. _NEW WAYS OF SEEING_
9. _MAKE SPACE TO THINK_
10. _BE THE NERD_
11. _STAY FOCUSED AND KEEP SHIPPING_
12. _NOTHING AT FACEBOOK IS SOMEBODY ELSE'S PROBLEM_
12. _BE OPEN_

I mean _BE OPEN_?
We were told _on that stage_ to _never_ talk to reporters, ever.

And Oh My Hashem, there was this one post with Mr. T on it that said
"I pity the fool who doesn't use âŒ˜T", what does that _mean_?
I don't have a mac but I assume it means open a new tab?
What fresh hell of office humor is this?
Why make someone feel bad about how they use a computer?
Who would laugh at that?
No one? Is that the point?

We recently bought a succulent and we're naming it "Succerberg".
Every time I see it I'll think of free food, meandering around
the office, not working, and listening to The Adventure Zone.
_That's_ what's so great about Facebook,
that's why you should work there.

That and $9,000 a month.

I was not asked to come back full-time.
