    <p>Janie and I often write the invitations for my friends’ house parties.
In order to get in the creative mood, we write some improvised stories
as an excercise. This is a collection of some of the better stories from
that excercise.</p>

<h1 id="1">1</h1>

<p>Michael regains consciousness only to realize he is still at CVS with
Janie.
“This is a dream <del>come true</del>, I’ve dreamed this before.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think they have my color” Janie said wistfully.</p>

<p>Michael followed his previous dreams to the letter, maybe this time
he wouldn’t have to fight homeless zombies using self help books.
Janie begins to leave and Michael eagerly follows.</p>

<p>“Is this it? I never found out what happens when I leave the CVS!”</p>

<p>As they exit Michael pleads “Slap me I must be dreaming!”.</p>

<p>Michael does not wake up, he remains awake and slapped.</p>

<h1 id="2">2</h1>

<p>A nondescript man sneaks into the “gogurt-geiser”, the place for all
dani-manufacturing. He slides a discrete splooge-bomb into the
factory core reactor, then slides out like a well made gogurt.</p>

<p>“Oh god, oh jeez… Gogurts have gone bankrupt from a huge ‘gurt
splooge spill?” Dr. Glockenload had paced through his lab twice over.</p>

<p>“Surely mother nature will pay, I must undo this horrible disaster!”</p>

<p>Dr. Glockenload constructs a tiny time machine that can only travel
through a tiny amount of time. It’ll be enough, it has to be.
Squeezing himself inside like a gogurt in reverse, he travels to the
gogurt factory fifteen minutes before the spill.</p>

<p>“I’m Brilliant!” Dr. Glockenload is feeling well.</p>

<p>After sneaking through most of the complex he finds the bomb.
Immediately attempting to disarm it, Dr. Glockenload finds a note
contained within. It reads: “Contained is the motivation for a brilliant invention”.
Dr. Glockenload opens a gogurt he knows will be his last,</p>

<p>“what is the price we must pay for science?” he whispers.</p>

<h1 id="3">3</h1>

<p>“Here we are folks, at the annual top cutie competition, and man have
we got some bangin’ competition. First up is Michael Eden!”</p>

<p>Michael Eden walks onto stage pretty normally, to uproarious
applause. Extreme catcalling can be heard from right in front of him,
where his girlfriend stands possessively. She is blocking him from
the sight of most, if not all women in the audience.</p>

<h1 id="4">4</h1>

<p>“This just in, a <em>space</em> bear that feeds off solar energy and can
travel through space has been discovered. Upon landing on Earth the
bear had this to say—”</p>

<p>“Sorry Wolf I’m gonna have to stop you right there we have breaking
news. Get this, a <em>space</em> hole has appeared in central florida, marking
the first time any hole has reached outer space. Florida is known for
its holes and—”</p>

<p>“Sorry Anderson, but a cat of news has <em>just</em> now been let out of its
bag. Moneybags and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said in a statement
today that after a lot of frustration he will create the first good
24 hour news channel.”</p>

<p>“Sorry Don, we’ll have to leave it there. If you’re just joining us
there has been a lot of news that you missed. After the break: we get
a lineup of labrador retrievers and ask everyday people ‘can <em>you</em> tell
which one is evil?’.”</p>

<h1 id="5">5</h1>

<p>Janie’s hands followed the trail of hair leading to Michael’s
erection. She grabs it in her hands, only to realize that it’s the
kind of cock that bursts into confetti. The rest of Michael’s body
follows suit.
Sitting in a heap of colourful paper shreds, Janie begins to paper
mache herself a new boyfriend.</p>

<p>He will be stickier this time, and unable to burst into confetti.</p>

<h1 id="6">6</h1>

<p>“Get gud or get rekt,” Michael whispers, cradling Janie’s unconscious
form with his super hot biceps and other arm stuff. He had just moved
his knight to B7, taking out all of her castles, bishops, and her
queen with the one splendid move. He very near took her life.
Her eyes fluttered open. Michael considers making the joke that he
couldn’t tell that her eyes opened. [He very near took his own life.]</p>

<p>“Checkm8 atheists,” she mouthed.</p>

<p>“W-what?!”</p>

<p>With an incredible move, Janie puts the last pawn in place. An
infinitude of pawns line diagonally to Michael’s king.</p>

<p>“Now that’s what I call pawn-ography.” She gives him a kiss and a slap on the ass.</p>

<p>“Not so fast, chum.” Michael kneels over the chessboard,
king pieces sliding saliva-coated out of his mouth and onto the board.
He wipes the spit off with a shirt sleeve:</p>

<p>“U’ve been playing checkers while i’ve been playing chess for years”</p>

    <p>— Michael</p>
