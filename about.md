Take a look at my [Resume](/assets/Resume.pdf).

## Javascript and this Blog

Many of my hippie foss friends will not run closed source javascript.
And since its difficult to keep track of what javascript is under what license
many just browse under [NoScript][noscript]. [NoScript][noscript] is a handy
tool that disables all javascript on a webpage, and lets you whitelist certain
pages too. It's used all the time on [Tor][tor] to prevent user tracking
and malicious scripts.

So I guarantee to you that this website is 100% usable without javascript.
You should see no change in experience whatsoever except for
not being able to leave comments.
If any future posts (e.g. video or WebGL) contain javascript then
only those posts (and no other parts of the site) will be broken.
I even made an icon (above) for it!
