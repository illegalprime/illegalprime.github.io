    The following list of readings are articles or excerpts from larger works
    for those of you who may not feel like devoting hours out of each day to
    diving deep into understanding Socialism. This reading list is for people
    who may get the basic gist of why Capitalism is bad, but who may not be
    too familiar with Socialism as a theory. Much of these works deal with
    secondhand interpretations or explanations, so please make sure to explore
    more fundamental works further down below.

    With these readings, you’ll have to think deeply, but maybe not as long or
    hard as you would have to think when reading an entire book:

  info: |
    Most of these works are incredibly long and dense,
    so many of you probably won’t take the time to read through them,
        but sites like [Marxists.org](https://marxists.org) or
    [TheAnarchistLibrary.org](https://TheAnarchistLibrary.org) have plenty of
    content that summarizes and provides analyses on much of
    what is shared here, and they also provide key excerpts.

    These are works that are considered essential readings for understanding
    the foundation upon which we base our socialist theory and/or understanding
    today, in conjunction with historical records
    (in other words: **this is some OG sh!t**):

    The following readings (which we don't expect everyone to read in
    their totality, given the collective length) were written by figures who
    actually [implemented various forms of State Capitalism and supported
    authoritarianism](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/voline-red-fascism),
    but who are mistakenly considered by many to be among the first individuals
    to bring “real” Socialism or Communism to the world.
    The values in these works, along with certain Anarchist works,
    are also frequently operationalized by fascists all around the world (see
    [here](https://libcom.org/library/investigation-red-brown-alliances-third-positionism-russia-ukraine-syria-western-left)
    for more on this).

    It is important to take from their works whatever knowledge we can,
    but to also look at the facts and/or history in conjunction with this
    knowledge in order to gain a more serious understanding of what actually
    occurred in much of the 20th century; Aimé Césaire’s
    [1956 letter](http://abahlali.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/153945859-Aime-Cesaire-Letter-to-Maurice-Thorez-1956.pdf)
    announcing resignation from the French Communist Party
    is a relevant introduction on this point.
    We also recommend everyone read the works of
    [Gavriil Myasnikov](https://www.marxists.org/archive/miasnikov/index.htm)
    , an OG Bolshevik who was imprisoned under Lenin and executed under Stalin
    for challenging hypocrisy within the Communist Party:

    it comes to developing more of an understanding of what the Socialist
