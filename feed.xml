Easter-European manly-man who likes looking at himself.
Sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things we like to do sometimes is Improv, and
a cool thing about Improv is that if you pay the theater
enough then you can get on stage with minimal experience.
That’s pretty cool!
And Dad’s Garage (the theater) is a non-profit that is
genuinely one of the coolest places I’ve had the
privilege of being a part of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway I wanted to brag about myself with some pictures
from my friend’s flip phone of the first night I ever
went on a stage, in front of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear I didn’t get paid, Janie like to call me a
“Volunteer Comedian”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kids were downloading Game Maker and using its GUI programming
to make the snake game THEY DESERVED.
I, was above it all, for I didn’t make a snake game, I made a&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;font-family:monospace&quot; class=&quot;middle&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h1 style=&quot;font-size:4rem&quot;&gt;M a z e&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;G a m e&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enlisted the most talented gamer I knew,
who quickly grasped its elegant controls:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article-img&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;/media/2019-08-18-maze-game-3/discord.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/media/2019-08-18-maze-game-3/discord.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article-img&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;/media/2019-08-18-maze-game-3/instructions.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;blockquote style=&quot;border-left: 10px solid #D5D5D5;&quot;&gt;(photo of the instructions he was reading)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One instruction is so clear is beings with “Ok try to remember this”.
Another reminds you that lasers kill you
“as in the character you not the viewer or reader of this”.
This was also the time I started to experiment with pixel art:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article-img&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;/media/2019-08-18-maze-game-3/avatar.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I need to sell this game any more to you,
please play it now. Only one person has beaten the whole thing
and most people don’t have the patience to get through &lt;strong&gt;all 40 levels&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider yourself lucky! This game was almost lost forever after I forgot to
save a copy from my Windows XP machine (the family computer). I had uploaded
a copy to YoYo Games’ servers but then they got sold and deleted everyone’s
games! Thankfully the Archive Team did a (mostly complete) backup of everyone’s
games! Checkout all these other
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=GameMaker_Sandbox&quot;&gt;lower-tier games&lt;/a&gt;

questions I’ve ever received so that &lt;em&gt;you too&lt;/em&gt; can annihilate and commit genocide
on technical interview questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I wanted to share some thoughts on the general process.
If you’re an interviewer, please:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t&lt;/strong&gt; schedule a call just to reject me, I don’t want an email that just
says you have “a quick update” but you’d “rather speak on the phone”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do&lt;/strong&gt; tell me a did a great job, even if I was mediocre.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do&lt;/strong&gt; give me problems that I find challenging but that I ultimately solve.
Make their difficulty just within reach so I feel really good about solving them.
That psychological calculation also tells me that
I’m “lucky to work here” because I “barely made it” rather than a super easy
problem that doesn’t make me feel special.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t&lt;/strong&gt; be offended if I try to squeeze everything from this offer I possibly
can.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t&lt;/strong&gt; tell me you have my best interests at heart. Your goal as a
recruiter is to make me sign and give me as little information as you can
get away with. If I find out I don’t like something &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; I’ve started I’m
more likely to try to live with it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t&lt;/strong&gt; hire me. Where’s your diversity? I am a child.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good interview will scale the level of difficultly and make the candidate feel
accomplished at every step, like a good video game
(that is, only if you actually want to hire him/her/them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make me feel special, lure me in, then wring me out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because they’re listed here doesn’t mean I can solve them.
I’ll keep adding to this list as I get more questions
(which will hopefully be very rarely, interviewing is no fun).
The Questions (in no particular order):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;multiplication-table&quot;&gt;Multiplication Table&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Print an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; multiplication table, keep the widths of the columns consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;calculator&quot;&gt;Calculator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evaluate a mathematical expression like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1 + 3 * 2&lt;/code&gt; and respect the traditional
order of operations. This is sometimes given with / without parenthesis,
but you generally just do
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pin-check&quot;&gt;PIN Check&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write a function that lives on an embedded device that checks if a given pin is
equal to a stored pin. This might seem easy at first but it was asked from a
security point-of-view so it needed to be resistant against timing and
power-glitching attacks (and maybe more that I don’t know about).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;leader-board&quot;&gt;Leader Board&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write a data structure to hold a leader board for a video game.
You must be able to efficiently insert and update a player’s score
&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; efficiently retrieve the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; best player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;string-subset&quot;&gt;String Subset&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a list of (English) words and a set of characters, which word is the
shortest and uses all the characters in the set?
What if this wasn’t just English?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;duplicate-strings&quot;&gt;Duplicate Strings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a large text find duplicate sections larger than &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; characters within it
(efficiently, of course).
If &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;k = 3&lt;/code&gt; and the text was “sea shells by the seashore” then &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sea&lt;/code&gt; is
a duplicate because its at least &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; characters and appears more than once.
You should be able to do this in linear time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lru-cache&quot;&gt;LRU Cache&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got this one twice already!
This is a cache that has a limited capacity &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;, it will cache that many values
until the limit is reached. If the cache is over capacity it will drop its
Least Recently Used (LRU) key. A use counts as retrieving or setting the value.
It’s well-known that both operations of this cache (setting and getting) must
preform in constant time and there’s many examples online of how to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;median-across-lists&quot;&gt;Median Across Lists&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given two &lt;em&gt;sorted&lt;/em&gt; lists return the median you would get if you were to combine
the two lists. This should be in logarithmic time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;leaf-to-leaf&quot;&gt;Leaf to Leaf&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find the longest path in a tree from a root to a leaf, then find the longest
path between leaves (without repeating edges of course).
This is in linear time and lends itself well to recursion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;breaking-the-safe&quot;&gt;Breaking the Safe&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A safe is guarded by a number pad that accepts a four digit pin.
There’s no “submit” button though so as soon as you enter the correct
four digits the safe will unlock. This means entering “12345” will have
the effect of attempting “1234” and “2345”.
What’s the shortest string that brute-forces all combinations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is actually some graph theory behind this that I learned a while ago
but I don’t remember, but under some (all?) conditions it should be
possible to find the minimum-length string.
I wasn’t given a time constraint here because of the limited solution space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-sum-below&quot;&gt;2 Sum Below&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a list of numbers find the two largest numbers whose sum is below &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;k&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;word-reverse&quot;&gt;Word Reverse&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reverse the order of words in a sentence, not the characters within the words.
My favorite solution is in Haskell:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-haskell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rev_words&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;unwords&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;reverse&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;words&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is easy so the usual follow-up is how to do it in constant space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;find-the-diff&quot;&gt;Find the Diff&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given two lists of integers, find the one element that is different in both
of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is really instructive because you go from an &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-time
solution all the way down to an &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;log&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; and even &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;.
You can also do this in &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; time and &lt;em&gt;constant&lt;/em&gt; space!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;coin-change&quot;&gt;Coin Change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a value &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; and a list of coin denominations find all the possible ways
to represent &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; in the given denominations (the number of ways to make
change for cash).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;grid-path&quot;&gt;Grid Path&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can only walk up and to the right on a two-dimensional grid, how many
possible ways are there to get to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;(x, y)&lt;/code&gt;? Note that there’s a formula
(close form) for this so technically this can be solved in constant time but
I’ve never been asked to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-sum&quot;&gt;3 Sum&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a list of numbers, find all triplets that sum to zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fibonacci&quot;&gt;Fibonacci&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calculate the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Fibonacci number.
This is often asked in the form of “do a slow recursive one”, then
“a fast recursive one”, then a “fast non-recursive one”.
Although if you didn’t know about recursion you’d probably get to the
answer they want quicker.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="code" /><summary type="html">I’ve been interviewing again recently and I wanted to share all the technical

Soon a herd of young early-twenty-somethings begins to form and amoebas its way across suburban Palo Alto.
We’re all funneled by exceptionally loud organizers into a bus and driven to
1 Hacker Way, a.k.a. Zuck-town (or Zuckerberg, I guess).
I sat next to a Journalism intern; he blew my mind by telling me that
Facebook wants to hire journalists, but why?
It was a different time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article-img&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m greeted by some &lt;em&gt;really cool l33t&lt;/em&gt; playfully calling me a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;n00b&lt;/code&gt;,
but it’s too early and I’m too sensitive to being patronized.
Would you greet your new employee with a reminder of how inexperienced they are?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article-img&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

I can’t call it dumb because &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://tulip.co/&quot;&gt;workplace&lt;/a&gt; has a pirate flag,
so I’ll call it a cheap appeal to make me forget that my work is at best meaningless
and at worst spreading click bait and anti-vaxxer propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article-img&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the worst part of working at Facebook and the orientation were all these
signs that made feel bad for not being as excited as they were to be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The also had Black Lives Matter signs mixed in,
which is an excellent movement to support.
They should’ve destroyed all their signs &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; Black Lives Matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But apart from that we got:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;BUILD SOCIAL VALUE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;EXPECT TO FEEL DIFFERENT&lt;/em&gt; (like after eating the food?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;MOVE FAST&lt;/em&gt; (like to the bathroom?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;DOUBT YOUR DOUBTS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;PROCEED AND BE BOLD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;FOCUS ON IMPACT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;THIS IS YOUR COMPANY NOW&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;NEW WAYS OF SEEING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;MAKE SPACE TO THINK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;BE THE NERD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;STAY FOCUSED AND KEEP SHIPPING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTHING AT FACEBOOK IS SOMEBODY ELSE’S PROBLEM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;BE OPEN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean &lt;em&gt;BE OPEN&lt;/em&gt;?
We were told &lt;em&gt;on that stage&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; talk to reporters, ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Oh My Hashem, there was this one post with Mr. T on it that said
“I pity the fool who doesn’t use ⌘T”, what does that &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt;?
I don’t have a mac but I assume it means open a new tab?
What fresh hell of office humor is this?
Why make someone feel bad about how they use a computer?
Who would laugh at that?
No one? Is that the point?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently bought a succulent and we’re naming it “Succerberg”.
Every time I see it I’ll think of free food, meandering around
the office, not working, and listening to The Adventure Zone.
&lt;em&gt;That’s&lt;/em&gt; what’s so great about Facebook,
that’s why you should work there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That and $9,000 a month.&lt;/p&gt;

It took all her strength to curl them away from her desk and onto Derl. She began in her signature slow southern drawl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Varmon? Would you like to share?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Derl Varmon stood up. His eyes were wide satellites, large and sensitive enough to absorb any signals of validation that might emit from Ms. Bronson. As he contorted his face in thought he garnered some attention as a rare and welcome source of entertainment. Reliable too, since he’d been standing for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Uh…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Derl frantically swam through a fecal ocean of answers, vision browned, swatting for a needle. As he stood, a layer of sweat condensed on his skin and gilded his forehead, his mouth opened but no word dared be the first. He bartered, begged, and clawed his mind for answers, but after some time he narrowed his eyes, dimmed his reception, and braced for Ms. Bronson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ll repeat my question, W—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he felt it! Deep in his gut, oh wait, his mind: the feeling of confidence, of relief, of response. Syllables, words, then clauses poured out of his mouth as if his entire lunch became one thorough thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So slavery? Heh. That’s what black people were at first, but not &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;. Now I’m really nice to them, heh, no I mean, whenever we look at someone we shouldn’t see black, yellow, red, or brown, we shouldn’t see anything. We have to move past that, we can all live equally now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mhmm. That was a very critical thought.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Derl sat, his ears vacuumed her praise. Seven words, ten syllables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Remember! &lt;em&gt;Critical Thinking&lt;/em&gt; is a vitally important class, if you don’t learn how to think critically now, how’ll you &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; to a good college? So you can &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; a balanced job? So you’ll have &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; for your family?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classroom was silent. Most fell asleep during the video miniseries, but the students who felt too guilty about disrespecting Civil Rights instead grew resentful that the movement had such a soothing and monotone narrator. A few black students who made it through the video exchanged looks of disbelief. Derl returned a thumbs up and a smile in their direction, his face was excessively understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A…ny…o…ne…? Varmon can’t be the only one with opinions on African Americans.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The silence grew stronger. More confident in its identity now, it felt this time wouldn’t be eclipsed by &lt;em&gt;Bronson&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay. Remember all y’all have an essay on your opinion of the Civil Rights movement due tomorrow. That’ll wrap up ‘The American Race: A Race Against Time’… but I’ll give ya’ll a sneak peak of our next unit ‘Think like a Mathtermind’. Here’s somethin’ to get us thinking. Who can tell me… the highest probability?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Derl heard a whisper immediately behind him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“one point oh”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Startled, he left the comfort of Ms. Bronson to turn back and see an unremarkable Jesús Cabello. Jesús returned him a vacant, uncomfortable look. Derl slowly turned back around, he knew the face of his enemy. The whisper, however, tapered into nothing a few desks away from Derl, allowing Silence to blanket the room again. It hoped dearly &lt;em&gt;Bronson&lt;/em&gt; would collapse from her exhaustion, but underestimated her perseverance in reading lesson outlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“1.0, for example, is a valid answer. You’ll soon see there are a lot of correct answers in Math, and they each can depend on &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; individual perspective! Now, who knows the probability of being completely uncertain about something?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Derl began mouthing through numbers, but he only finished a few before he heard it again, a little louder this time, and flinched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“the probability of being completely uncertain about something … one half”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Derl slowly crumples his notebook paper containing some numbers below one, flicks it off his desk, and lands it perfectly on top of his thermos. A slight smile broke his stern face, and he relaxed some more in his chair. Bronson waits another minute, making a sizable dent in the twenty he had left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One half! That’s what you’re all thinking right? That is right, but not &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt;. Sometimes it’s a quarter, sometimes an eighth, it can be an infinite number of answers! But think about that, one half and one point oh. There’s &lt;em&gt;not a lot&lt;/em&gt; of room between being sure of something and not being sure at all. Remember that when you’re thinking critically, not just about math, but the news, your decisions, your lives.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“…your decisions, your lives”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesús repeated every word out of Bronson’s mouth, all but mocking her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you throw a ball on the floor, you have no way of knowing exactly where it’s going to land. You might be able to know roughly where, but never precisely. But think about this, what would happen if we &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; know exactly where a ball lands? Could we win tomorrow’s lottery? Make a perfect lie detector? Tell the &lt;em&gt;future&lt;/em&gt;? What won’t we know? That’s what a crack critical thinker should be considering…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Derl listened closely, penciling, condensing, and internalizing all Ms. Bronson had to say. He had learned so much from her, his parents, his church, because nothing frightened Derl more than the ‘Avoidable Mistake’. The mistake that’s haunted, in retrospect, everyone in history, since it teaches a trite and timeworn lesson that its transgressors only recognize too late. They wish they had listened to that one person about that one thing, it dangles what could have been everywhere they look, it taunts them. So, to reliably avoid that personal horror Derl, around the fifth grade, started keeping a notebook full of his mentors’ lessons, maybe he could do better than they:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wait until your one true love to lose your virginity, women can smell when you’ve been with someone else.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sharing &lt;em&gt;Younique&lt;/em&gt; cosmetics uplift, empower, and validate women everywhere, and let you earn a financial reward at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Secret&lt;/em&gt; contains life-changing tools to become your best self and reveal those pesky secrets of life.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Love is all you need. As long as you love enough, you can survive heartbreak or a heart attack.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t be a dawdling dingus, buy low, sell high!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t listen to your father, earn some money so you can be happy, and have a happy family.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have to be careful when you say you’re sure about something because one is very close to one half. You have to think critically about everything to really get to the bottom of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“… But think about this! We know roughly where a ball will land. How is it that so many combinations of infinite possibilities end up so predictable? How do so many unique people end up so similar?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“…people end up SO SIMILAR”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Cabello, would you –”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Cabello, would you”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“– like to share?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“– like to share?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bronson’s eyes widened and locked onto Jesús.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Cabello I expect you to –”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Cabello I expect you to”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“– talk to me–”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“talk to me”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“– like –”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“like”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“– an –”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“an adult.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cabello ran ahead one word, but ‘adult’ was clearly next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“– adult.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ca–”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Cabello do not come in here and fuck with me. I know you, I’ve seen a lot of kids exactly like you. Hell your dad mows my lawn, and you’ll be take over the business right? You’ll end up alone with that depressing job and a sorry life if you keep this up … you’ll ruin any future you had left. I’m not getting anything out of this, I’ll be sitting here teaching, getting paid above minimum wage. Take this opportunity to do right by yourself and by your family. Or are you just going to give up, feel sorry, and lay bricks for the rest of your life? This is America son, you can make it, but only if you actually try a little.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I don’t have to listen to this, get the fuck out of my classroom!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cabello ran an entire rant ahead. Bronson stared in disbelief at Jesús Cabello, who only returned an empty and hollow look. An uncomfortable silence reclaimed power over the room, but only held it for a few minutes. Then Jesús spoke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Something really strange happened to me today.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Really? God, right when I come home? It’s, uh, chicken and rice.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Then what would you like?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“O.K. Chicken and rice.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesús paused for a few seconds, then continued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I wanted to tell you something…”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Wait, would you listen? I have a… You’re going to be a dad!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I think about a month ago.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What do you mean ‘is it too late’? We’re not even considering–”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I thought you’d be more excited.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I know, yeah, that is more like you.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I think baby Charlie ’ll bring us closer, we’ll be a complete family!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Yesterday.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I’m sorry. We talked about this, I thought we were on the same page.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“O.K. I’ll go next week.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Charlie?  Don’t leave the table!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another small pause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Mom? Hi.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Hey mom, no, hang on.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“No. Mom wait.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I told Charlie, he didn’t like it.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I understand what he’s sayin’, but it’s the way–.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Is that how Dad took it?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesús’ speech slowly sped up, finally reaching a terminal inhuman tempo. Jesús, or “The Cantor” as he’s now known, became unintelligible. Those listening to his psalms could only glean the coarser details. Eventually his monologue of arguments became apologies, then pleads, then a probability lesson, and it began to follow some pattern of emotion. Jesús could fit everything Bronson would ever say into his sermon, her entire life painted in a single stroke by a small Hispanic boy. The classroom clock’s minute hand bolted through years of life. As it reach the hour Jesús’ voice grew raspy and frail, Derl could read the class was nearing its end. Then Jesús froze, gazing into a distant nothing, still and speechless. Quiet he stood for what, at this speed, must’ve been an eternity, until he collapsed on the floor. The bell rang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, as Ms. Bronson knew, collapsing on a stone floor is noiseless, but Jesús fell  arms wide open on his long-unacquainted classmate next to him, unconscious. The girl below him woke up screaming, rolling his body off hers and allowing his head to thump on the stone floor. Jesús was a rag doll, his mouth firmly suctioned to the tiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ms. Teacher you killed that poor boy!” She yelled, pointed and delegated to Bronson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms. Bronson stood paralyzed staring at Jesús. Her stasis only broke a few seconds after the student’s loud and irritating scream. She grabbed her coat, attempted to excuse herself, and ran into a crowded hallway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Derl still sat there, disappointed. Later an investigation revealed he was the only one awake through the entire hour. He recited his account to the school principal and a state detective:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ms. Bronson asked a question, and then Jesús started acting up, like always. J.C. was just trying to get on Ms. Bronson’s nerves, and he did good too. Heh, he even pretended to go to boneless! But I didn’t get to hear the rest of the lesson, I was taking notes, look!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Thanks!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well after that Ms. Bronson ran out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, she left us.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="prose" /><summary type="html">Ms. Bronson’s eyes are tired, glazed red, and live in individual craters above her nose.

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;spooktacular&quot;&gt;Spooktacular&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait-listed for a class… that isn’t offered?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friends mysteriously missing from your friends list??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thought you saw a black cat… but you don’t see color??? (thanks obama)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;there can only &lt;img width=&quot;25px&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; src=&quot;/media/2017-01-11-jan14-spooktacular/bee.png&quot; /&gt; 1 explanation:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kick-off-your-very-best-semester-yet-new-year-new-u&quot;&gt;kick off your very best semester yet, new year, new u!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feat. ur favorite faces n friends and:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;better walk-in times than your advisers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the only non-dry house on campus&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a turned cheek from “Bud” Peterson&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a turnt cheek from “Bud (lite) Peterson”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pwp Buzz x Barry (from Bee Movie) fanfiction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;where&lt;/b&gt; North Avenue North Room 528
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;when&lt;/b&gt; Saturday 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; @ 10 pm, January 2017
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;who&lt;/b&gt; you + an arbitrary depth of friends of friends
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;september-ends&quot;&gt;September Ends&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do we cook bacon but bake cookies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right, every interaction we have is being recorded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case its in invitation form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why isn’t this message encrypted?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dGVkIGNydXogaXMgem9kaWFjCg==
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cat got on the keyboard again..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know cats are subsidized by our government to sedate America?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time you kiss your cat, pheromones are released in your bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, you won’t understand complex biology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody understands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is this about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about getting woke!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about waking up, when September ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;williams-birthday&quot;&gt;William’s Birthday&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TO START THE SCHOOL YEAR OFF RIGHT BY GETTING FFGUDRUNK&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WITH US AT THE 5 2 8 STILL REPPING THAT NORTH SIDE, STILL ON THIS SIDE OF THE MARTA, STILL HAVE DRINKS, MUSIC, BASS WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OH RIGHT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A REASON TO LIVE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OUR REASON IS WILLIAM GREENLEAF&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GRAB LIFE BY THE TESTICLES AND COME ON DOWN TO CELEBRATE WILLIAM’S 21st [ 2 + 1 = 3 : WILLUMINATI CONFIRMED ] BIRTHDAY!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BUT WHAT ELSE IS CONFIRMED?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;a william hour playlist of 21 Pilots&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 + 1 = 3 Days Grace&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;having  your birthday cake and drinking it too&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;becoming a man&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;political memes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“pls come” - Jeb Bush&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;april-fools&quot;&gt;April Fool’s&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some said it would be impossible: extending our spring break a week into the term!
But together we can make that dream a reality, together we can nurture our
collective denial
of our academic responsibilities, together we can make our week great again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comming to you from the 5 2 8 repping the North Side bringing you the
dopest party on this side
of the MARTA, feat. amazing drinks, music, games, and dank memes is the:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;end-of-the-week--middle-of-the-term-rager-back-to-school-edition&quot;&gt;END OF THE WEEK / MIDDLE OF THE TERM RAGER! (BACK TO SCHOOL EDITION)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Featuring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pepe the frog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An inevitable vomit-filled elevator&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A relaxed global perspectived requirement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dean Zvi in a Banana Hammock Mankini&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Michael not getting laid&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A windowsill of empty bottles and dreams&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;White dance moves&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A beatiful view of the cocola building&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Air Conditioning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;WiFi&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bass&lt;/li&gt;

If you’ve been kissing a girl or boy and want to take it to the &lt;strong&gt;next level&lt;/strong&gt;,
put on some nice woolen socks and start shuffling on a nearby rug. 
Wait for your special someone to come home and give them a kiss.
If you were disciplined enough to only touch lips, they should feel a strong
static shock. That’s when you whisper:&lt;/p&gt;
